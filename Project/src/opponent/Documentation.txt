Notes: 
---------------------------------------
1)
When there is a Player argument, the possibilities are:
white, black.
Any other value will result in failure or incorrect behaviour of the program.

2)
Player depends on Move_Checker, which in turn depends on Game_Board.
Without addition of these 2 extra files the player will not work.



Expected input from player for referee: 
---------------------------------------

- makeBoard(Width Height):

This function sets the size of the gameboard. 

- judgeMove(Board Move CurrentStrikeCount): 

Checks the move given by the player, if the move is correct it will be submitted on the board.
Board is the current state of the GameBoard.
Move is a tuple which could look like this: move(start: coord(x y) dest: coord(x y) player:white) 
with x being the coordinates on the height-axis and y being the coordinate on the width-axis and player being the player that made the move.
CurrentStrikeCount passes 

Expected input from referee to player: 
---------------------------------------

- getBoardSize: 

Let the player choose the size of the Board.

- doMove(Board Player CurrentStrikeCount)

Asks the player to make a move.
CurrentStrikeCount shows the amount of strikes the player has recieved this turn for making wrong moves.
